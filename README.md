## Introduction

The Starter Unity Template Project for Maliyo Games is an excellent resource for game developers who want to get started with Unity. With this project, you can quickly create a new game that is ready to go, and it includes all the basic features that you need to get started.

One of the best things about this Starter Unity Template Project is that it is designed specifically for Maliyo Games. This means that it is optimized for the types of games that Maliyo Games typically creates, and it includes features that are commonly used in these games. 
**This Project works both for Landscape and Portrait Modes**
